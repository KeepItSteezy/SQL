# Analyses of 14 prompts using a sales sample database called Chinook containing 11 tables using SQLiteStudio
# Tables include albums, artists, customers, employees, genres, invoice items, invoices, media types, playlists, playlist tracks, and tracks

# Purpose of this project is to join 4+ tables containing sales data and product information for use to determine sales metrics and identify the top sales people at the company
